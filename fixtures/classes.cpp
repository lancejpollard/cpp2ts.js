  "experienced players. The number of monsters does not depend on the "
  "number of Hypersian Rugs you have collected, and there are more "

  "The mighty golems guarded those altars, making sure nobody steals the jewels, because a robbed god is a angry god. "
  "Unfortunately winter has come (maybe because only the monks knew how to stop the golems, and they were said to had escaped earlier with some of the jewels). "

  "or move its whole body forwards or "
  "backwards, it may also move a frontal part backwards. To kill a Dragon, "
  "you need to hit each of its segments. "
  "The head will regenerate on the "
  "turns the Dragon is not moving, so you will usually have to hit it with "
  "your last attack; otherwise, if the head is healthy, it may breathe "
  "fire (at range 3), losing the hitpoint. Killing the Dragon "
  "while still in the Dragon Chasms gives you treasure.";

const char *tortoisedesc =
  "Galápagos is the land of Tortoises. "
  "They are very slow, which allows the Dragons to pick on them by "
  "stealing and eating their young. Bring the Baby Tortoises back, "
  "but, there is a catch: the Tortoises come in many varieties, depending "
  "on the part of Galápagos they live in -- there are 21 binary environmental "
  "factors, and thus "
  "2097152 varieties. You'll have to find a "
  "Tortoise which matches the baby exactly!\n\n"

  "the widest creatures which could still move at considerable speed...\n\n"

  "Kraken heads can move only on hexagons. You need to attack all the tentacles to "
